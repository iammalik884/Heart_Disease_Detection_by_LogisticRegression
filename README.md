## Project Title
**Build a model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using the Logistic Regression Algorithm**

---

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **binary classification model** using **Logistic Regression** that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on several medical features such as chest pain type, cholesterol, resting ECG, and more.

---

## Why This Project?
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection through machine learning can:
- Assist doctors with early diagnosis
- Reduce treatment costs and save lives
- Promote preventive healthcare using data-driven insights

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression)
